**Final Project in Full-Stack web development**

In short:

We chose to create an application that simulates an online shopping website.
The website includes different types of users (admin and regular users), authentication, and permissions. Different types of actions based on the user. Databases and updates.

Upon entry, you can log in as an admin or a user. Access will be granted based on existing permissions or registration as a new user.

User Entry:

The user can browse categories and add the products they want to order. Additionally, they can update the quantity for a product or remove it from the cart. Finally, they can place the order, which will be saved in the order history in the personal area.

Admin Entry:

The admin can add, modify, or update products or details within the product.
